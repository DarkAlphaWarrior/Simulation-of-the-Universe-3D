# Simulation-of-the-Universe
Simulation of our world in 3d
The idea of the project is to simulate our Universe.
In the project you get 3d solar system simulation and simulation of the Earth 
(there you get an ocean globe and 
mainland (called for some reasons in the prject in Latin as terra), that works as a base for "stuff on earth"
i.e. trees, flowers, animals and a house)
You can move an Actor and interact with different objects like bed, fridge and tv.
There is also an Actress roaming in an apartment and doing different things (like sleeping, washing, watching tv, etc.)

Idially, there should work all the laws of physics, biology and chemics, describe the behavior of a human being
but I did it in a VERY simplified way.

For this project I used 3d model downloaded for free (from the resources like sweethome and other websites recomended there).
If you want to use part of my code for some purposes feel free to do it but let me know, please.
