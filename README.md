# Simulation-of-the-Universe
Simulation of our world in 3d
The idea of the project is to simulate our Universe.
In the project you get 3d solar system simulation and simulation of the Earth 
(there you get an ocean globe and 
mainland (called for some reasons in the prject in Latin as terra), that works as a base for "stuff on earth"
i.e. trees, flowers, animals and a house)

Idially, there should work the laws of physics, biology and chemics, describe the behavior of a human being
but unfortunately our civilization hasn't reached that level yet.
